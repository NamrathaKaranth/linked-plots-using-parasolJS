# Linked Plots using ParasolJS

Parasol JS is an open source visualization library that helps in developing web applications for multi-objective decision making. Using this library we can generate Linked Plots with many functionalities. The Parasol library is based on D3 V5 API and extends upon parcoords-es.

More Details about this library can be found at [Parasol JS](https://github.com/ParasolJS/parasol-es).

I have made this project to display two linked plots. The first one demonstrates Linked plots and SlickGrid along with a slider using which the transparency of the polylines could be altered. The second one demonstrates brushing across linked parallel coordinates plots and how buttons can be used to modify a Parasol object using the Parasol API. With this, linked plots can be displayed along with different functionalitites like selecting a part of data from the graph, removing the brushed data, and altering the number of clusters.

Few Images of the Web Application are as follows:
